# Substrate Blockchain: Core Concepts

This project provides a basic understanding of core components within a Substrate-based blockchain. 

**Key Concepts Covered:**

* **State Machine:** Introduction to the concept of a state machine and its role in blockchain operation.
* **Balances Pallet:** Explores how user balances are managed within the blockchain, including account creation, transfers, and balance updates.
* **System Pallet:** Delves into the core system functionalities, such as events, logging, and basic system operations.
* **Runtime Environment:** Explains the role of the Runtime in executing transactions, managing the blockchain's state, and coordinating interactions between different Pallets.
* **Block Execution:** Explores the process of block creation, including transaction inclusion, block finalization, and state transitions.

**Learning Objectives:**

* Gain a foundational understanding of Substrate's core components.
* Learn how Pallets contribute to the overall functionality of a blockchain.
* Understand the role of the Runtime in executing blockchain logic.
* Gain insights into the process of block creation and execution.

This project serves as a starting point for exploring the fundamentals of Substrate development and building your own custom blockchain applications.
